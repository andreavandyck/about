          <h2>My life</h2>
          <p class="life">
            I am 35 years old, engaged to the love of my life, and an
            ex-recruiter. I have a 1st class degree in music business, I love
            singing and music so thought I would like to work in the industry
            but had a hard time finding a job and also realised I didn't like
            the people and culture in the industry!
          </p>
          <h2 id="notice">Why am I here?</h2>
          <p>
            I'm here because I am trying to gain new skills to help me beuild an
            online based business. I have a page on instagram currently at 43k
            followers and I want to monetise properly, being able to run my own
            website and campaigns would be a great help. I'd also like to be
            able to charge people for my services in running campaigns for them!
